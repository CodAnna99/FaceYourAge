# FaceYourAge
Project Goal The goal of the project is to train a computer vision model on Edge Impulse to predict gender and age based on a personâ€™s profile photo. This model will be integrated into a simple frontend with picture upload functionality, allowing for on-the-fly use without relying on on-premise installations.
