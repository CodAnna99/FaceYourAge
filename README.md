# FaceYourAge
Project Goal The goal of the project is to train a computer vision model on Edge Impulse to predict gender and age based on a personâ€™s profile photo. This model will be integrated into a simple frontend with picture upload functionality, allowing for on-the-fly use without relying on on-premise installations.
The models were trained on approx. 23k images, all labeled with their gender (female/male) and age (1-116) with a 80/20 test split. 

## Ressources 

*   Edge Impulse CNN-Regression & Classification

# Prepare Frontend Code 

The fronend contains a (dramatic) background picture, made with [leonardo.ai](https://www.leonardo.ai) and uses simple CSS and JavaScript elements to produce a picture upload area and the AI generated results after upload. 

The frontend is in German.
